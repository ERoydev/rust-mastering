// Rc stands for Reference Counted pointer.
// It enables multiple ownership of the same data.
// Multiple Rc instances can point to the same heap-allocated value.
// The data is read-only shared (immutable) — no thread-safety guarantee (not Send or Sync).

/* 
Why use Rc?
Imagine you have some data that multiple parts of your app want to read and share, but:
    - You don’t want to clone the data (which could be expensive).
    - You don’t want to transfer ownership.
    - You want Rust to track how many owners there are, and automatically free the data when nobody owns it anymore.
    - Rc does exactly that using reference counting

    // a.clone() would do the same since `a` is Rc initiliazed but current syntax is prefferred
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
