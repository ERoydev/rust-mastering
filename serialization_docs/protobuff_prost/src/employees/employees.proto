package employees;

// In the protobuff, everything is labeled as a `Message`, so the employee is going to be turned into a message
message Employee {
    int32 id = 1; // Every property have a specified position
    string name = 2;
    float salary = 3;
} // This is a single Employee, a single object

// This is how i do an array of Employees
message Employees {
    repeated Employee employees = 1; // Repeated means array of Employees
}

// Now the question is how to turn this .proto file into a JavaScript file or Rust file
// that builds the Class that it's called Employee and Employees and all that stuff.
//
// For that we need to use the protoc compiler (Protobuff compiler).
// Feed it a .proto file and it generates code for you in the language of your choice.

// I have it installed in the Downloads from `protobuff releases` GitHub page:
//   /Users/myuser/Downloads/protoc-33.5-osx-aarch_64/bin/protoc
//
// But for Rust, I can just use the `prost-build` crate that wraps around the protoc compiler, without needing to install it manually,
// and makes it easier to use in Rust build scripts.
//
// Created build.rs file for that purpose, that automatically compiles my .proto file during the build process.
// main.rs shows how to include and use the generated Rust code.

// The compiled proto file will be in:
//   target/debug/build/protobuff_crash_course-xxxx/out/employees.rs
// where you can see the generated Rust code for the Employee and Employees messages.
